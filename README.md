### Goal
For this Episode of the Series, your task is to use **binary classification** to predict a patient's smoking status given information about various other health indicators.

### Dataset
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Smoker Status Prediction using Bio-Signals dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.



### Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on **area under the ROC curve** between the predicted probability and the observed target.

### Rank

I ranked 657th out of 1910 participants, which means I was in the **top 34.6%**.
